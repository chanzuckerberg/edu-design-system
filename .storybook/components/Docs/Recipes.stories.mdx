# Recipes

Recipes are code examples that show EDS components in context of a larger feature.

## How does a feature become a recipe?

Recipes come from pilots where the EDS team designs a feature or page that will use one or more EDS components. Those pilots are undertaken specifically for the purpose of creating new EDS components and patterns. The EDS team does not implement the resulting design in the product surface area; instead, the EDS team creates the components and also creates recipes showing the components in action. The product team can then use the recipes as a examples for how to implement the feature themselves.

## Does every feature that uses EDS in a product become a recipe?

No, not every feature that uses an EDS component becomes a recipe. If a product team is developing a feature or page on their own and uses an EDS component, the EDS team does not add that feature as a recipe in EDS. Recipes only come from features that the EDS team designs (or codesigns with another team).

## Are recipes imported and used in other products like components?

No, recipes are not used directly in other products. They can be used as examples of how to implement a component on the code side or as general examples of how components can be used in a user interface, but that's all.

## What functions do recipes perform?

Aside from serving as examples for how components can be used (in a user interface or in a code context), they also serve as tests to verify that the components continue to work in the context of a larger feature or page.
