# Recipes

From [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-system-components-recipes-and-snowflakes/):

> Recipe components are specific compositions of design system components (for the most part) that are to be consistently used across a product, but arenâ€™t agnostic enough to live in the design system.

Your team may have some recipes already! To learn more about those, refer to your team's tab in [ZeroHeight](https://eds.czi.design/). The page will contain themed recipes specific to your product. If curious, you can find a similar page for other teams' recipes as well.
