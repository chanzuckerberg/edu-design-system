# Design Tokens

EDS is a [themeable design system](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/creating-themeable-design-systems/) in order to support different brands, design language generations, and product families. [Design tokens](https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/) are a core part of building a EDS theme. Design tokens define low-level design values and apply those values to UI applications in order to manage the brand's look and feel separately from structural component styles.

## Style Dictionary

EDS uses [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) to manage design tokens. Style Dictionary transforms design token source files into various formats, including CSS variables, Sass variables, JSON, and native app-specific formats.

Tokens are defined as a collection of JSON files, which then get converted by Style Dictionary into the appropriate format — namely CSS custom properties — to be consumed by EDS components.

## Design token architecture

Design tokens live at `src/design-tokens`. Primitive (tier-1) tokens live in `primitives.json`, and theme (tier-2/tier-3) tokens live in `themes.json`.

For typography tokens, thes directory structure is stored in the following tree:

```css
design-tokens
 |--tier-1-definitions
 |--tier-2-usage
 |--tier-3-component
```

- `tier-1-definitions` define the brand's core design values, serving as the raw materials for the UI's visual design.
- `tier-2-usage` house the semantic design values, which take Tier 1 token values and map them to specific UI applications.
- `tier-3-component` house the component-specific design values, which allow for more nuanced theming for components.

All tokens are prefixed with `eds-` to serve as a namespace and identifier for working with the system in production applications.

EDS's token architecture and nomenclature is as follows:

## Tier 1 tokens

[Tier 1 tokens](/?path=/docs/design-tokens-tier-1-definitions--docs) define the brand's design values. They can be thought of as a brand style guide converted into variables. Tier1 token values should not imply any UI usage, and should not be used directly by components. Instead, Tier 1 values should be mapped to Tier 2 values.

### Animation <a name="tier-1-animation"></a>

- `anim-fade-` for fading between frames (e.g. button background color changes, banner messages fading out, etc). Typically default to "quick" and "long" as values.
- `anim-move-` for defining movement durations (e.g. a modal floating up from the bottom of the screen, etc)

### Borders <a name="tier-1-borders"></a>

- `border-width-` for border widths. EDS defaults to abbreviated t-shirt sizes (e.g. `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) in accordance with the [EDS code guidelines](./?path=/story/documentation-guidelines-code-guidelines--page).
- `border-radius-` for border radius values. EDS defaults to t-shirt sizes, with additional "full" and "round"

### Breakpoints <a name="tier-1-breakpoints"></a>

- `bp-` for breakpoint. Typically default to t-shirt sizes (e.g. `bp-sm`, `bp-md`, etc). EDS [deliberately avoids](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/7-habits-of-highly-effective-media-queries/) using "mobile" and "tablet" and "desktop" as values, despite it being a common nomenclature. 

**NOTE**: These are currently defined directly as SCSS variables due to lack of support at the moment for CSS custom property media queries.

### Colors <a name="tier-1-colors"></a>

Tier 1 colors define ranges of colors across various hues. Numbers indicate various saturations, and can be used as a guide for choosing accessible combinations.

### Shadows <a name="tier-1-shadows"></a>

- `box-shadow-` for box shadow definitions. Default to t-shirt sizes (e.g. `box-shadow-lg`).

### Size <a name="tier-1-size"></a>

We use size tokens, based on an 8-pixel grid size. Variables are prefixed with `--eds-spacing-size` and have units corresponding to 8 pixels each. We also provide tokens for some partial sizes (e.g,. 1.5 grid units, or 12 pixels).

### Typography <a name="tier-1-typography"></a>

- `typography-font-family-` for font family definitions. EDS defaults to a numeric list for font-family definitions.
- `typography-font-weight-` for the different weights. EDS defaults to "light", "medium", and "bold".
- `typography-letter-spacing` for the spacing between text characters. EDS defaults to "extended", "normal", and "condensed".

Individual presets and typography tokens are defined as a set of values to apply to the [CSS Font property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font).
See [Typography](/story/documentation-guidelines-typography--page) for more information.

### Z-index <a name="tier-1-z-index"></a>

- `z-index-` controls an item's position in the stacking order. For now, EDS defaults to values that map to "top", "bottom".

## Tier 2 usage tokens

[Tier 2 tokens](/?path=/docs/design-tokens-tier-2-usage--docs) define a semantic UI layer. Tier 2 values use Tier 1 token values, mapping them to specific UI applications, which are in then used by individual component styles.

All Tier 2 tokens begin with the prefix `eds-theme-`. For specific documentation around specific theme tokens, please refer to the token page in Storybook, which articulate the role of each theme token.

### Borders <a name="tier-2-borders"></a>

- `border-width` defines the border width for the thickness. EDS defaults to `border-width-sm`.

### Colors <a name="tier-2-colors"></a>

Tier 2 color tokens specify categorization of colors, given a specific use within an application. The naming categories specify where and when they are used, but not which components they are used for, specifically. For that, we would use [tier-3 tokens](#tier-3-component-tokens).

Each token in this group is prefixed by `--eds-theme-color` and has certain suffixes based on the the broad categorization.

For more information, [refer to Storybook](/story/design-tokens-tier-2-usage--colors) for the existing tokens and their naming.

## Tier 3 Component Tokens <a name="tier-3-component-tokens"></a>

[Tier 3 component tokens](/?path=/docs/design-tokens-tier-3-component--docs) represent each component's specific values.

See the current set of tier 3 tokens [in storybook](/story/design-tokens-tier-3-component--colors). Note: many of these are deprecated and will be removed in a future release of EDS.
