# Theming

Below are instructions on how to use the tooling, configs, and tokens to define custom theme values for a project.

## Using Tailwind with the Default Theme

Out of the box, EDS provides a basic tailwind configuration to use in any project. The provided EDS tailwind config hooks up EDS tokens to useful utility classes and some screen sizes. To import the tailwind config into the app's tailwind config, supply the [theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) property for use:

```ts
// in your tailwind.config.ts
import edsConfig from '@chanzuckerberg/eds/tailwind.config';

module.exports = {
  content: ['./app/**/*.{ts,tsx,jsx,js}'],
  theme: edsConfig.theme,
  // ... any other tailwind config
};
```

If you need to preserve any existing theme values, you can use `extend` and pull contents from the imported theme file. Options to extend include:

- `colors`
- `fontWeight`
- `fontFamily`
- `screens`

You can review the [Tailwind Theme Customization][tailwind-theme] documentation, and the contents of the [provided config][eds-tailwind-config], and apply the parts you want to use.

### Tailwind color options and guidance

With the proper tailwind setup, there are several options one can use to access the EDS tokens. Here are guidelines
for which utility classes to use when you need color tokens (in order of preference):

#### ✅ Using EDS token utility classes

These map to the higher-tier token names, and are semantic- (or component-) based.

```tsx
<div className="text-utility-interactive-primary-visited">Option 1</div>
```

#### ✅ Token name references using CSS variables

If there is no existing utility class for the use case, you can reference the token directly in a class. While less preferable to the above, this still plugs into EDS.

```tsx
<div className="bg-[var(--eds-theme-color-text-utility-interactive-primary-visited)]">
  Option 2
</div>
```

Cons:

- less useful IntelliSense (no color chip)
- longer class names that may cause wrapping, and are harder to scan visually

#### ❌ Token name references pointing to tier-1 (primitive) tokens

This is similar to the above, but instead of using semantically-named tokens, uses the raw token primitives. This is equivalent to hard-coding magic numbers and has the same consequences.

```tsx
<div className="bg-[var(--eds-color-purple-550)]">Option 3</div>
```

Cons (same as above, plus):

- would require delicate refactoring if any usages change (which references should remain and which should change?)

#### ❌ Using inline hex values

This is the worst option, which fully detaches from EDS. ONLY appropriate if there is no intent to be consistent with the rest of the app theme. Use at your own risk!

```tsx
<div className="bg-[#8A50A7]">Option 4</div>
```

Cons (same as above, plus):

- fully detached from EDS, and harder to control or maintain.

## Setting up and using the theming tooling

EDS comes with some optional tooling to allow easy transfer of theme data from Figma (or some style-dictionary compatible format) into code.

- `eds-init-theme` - This command creates the initial file(s) for theming your application
- `eds-apply-theme` - This command parses the local config file to generate the tokens used by EDS components and tools
- `eds-import-from-figma-api` - This command reads from figma, and applies token values to the theme in the app

Each of these tools reads config to figure out where to read/write files.

First, create a configuration file to determine the source and destination directories. This can be defined in a new file `.edsrc.json` in your project root. Example:

```json
// in a new file .edsrc.json
{
  "src": "src/components/",
  "dest": "src/components/"
}
```

- `src` determines where the core theme file will be copied to (upon running `eds-init-theme`) OR read from (upon running `eds-apply-theme`)
- `dest` determines where the generated CSS variable files will be written to (upon using `eds-apply-theme`). Once creating the config file, you can use the commands below.

### eds-init-theme

Command to run: `npx eds-init-theme`

This will create a new JSON file `app-theme.json` that defines ALL the available tokens for EDS that you can edit. It will copy the template file to configured `src` path in your project.

This file is a baseline config to be used later in the process.

### eds-apply-theme

Command to run: `npx eds-apply-theme`

Using `eds-apply-theme` will read in the newly-created `app-theme.json` file, and create the tokens to use in your project.

Once run, you will have a set of theme files written to the configured `dest` path:

- `app-theme.css` (CSS file containing custom CSS variables with the theme values for the application)
- `app-tailwind-theme.config.json` (Configuration file for configuring tailwind in the application)

To use, add this file to your core app root file **after** where the imported EDS's `@chanzuckerberg/eds/index.css` file is inserted.

### eds-import-from-figma-api

Command to run: `npx eds-import-from-figma-api`

When using a [Figma Enterprise account][figma-enterprise], core design system files can be accessed to extract the token values, [using the API][figma-api-docs].

Example:

```
npx eds-import-from-figma-api file <file_id> --token <personal_access_token>
```

**NOTE**: when using this method, it requires both the figma file ID (e.g., `figma.com/design/<file_id>/`), and an API token. Instructions from Figma [are here][figma-access-token-docs].

[figma-access-token-docs]: https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens

## Custom Theming and Tailwind

When you have your own custom theme, you can use the tokens provided in `app-tailwind-theme.config.json` to do advanced tailwind configuration. This file contains all the tokens in JSON format, mapped to the literal values in your local theme.

EDS provides a utility method to pull in the theme config and generate the proper tailwind 3.x config object.

**NOTE**: Tailwind 4.x support to come in a future release of EDS.

```ts
// in your tailwind.config.ts file
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';
import {applyTailwindConfig} from '@chanzuckerberg/eds/tailwind.config';
import {eds as customTokens} from "./<edsrc.json:dest>/app-tailwind-theme.config.json"; // where <edsrc.json:dest> is the path configured in .edsrc.json

// export the following
export default {
  // your project's `content` array
  content: ['./app/**/*.{ts,tsx,jsx,js}'],
  theme: {
    ...applyTailwindConfig(customTokens)
    // ...any local theme overrides and additions...
  },
} satisfies Config

```

<hr />

If there are any future updates to the theme, edit the contents of `app-theme.json`, then re-run `npx eds-apply-theme`. Then commit the changes, and that's it!
