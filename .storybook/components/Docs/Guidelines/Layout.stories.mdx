# Layout

Please refer to our documentation [on ZeroHeight](https://eds.czi.design/styleguide/s/36770/p/17f0a9-layout/b/66febf)
for suggested alternatives and patterns.

## Spacing and alignment

EDS components do not include margin properties as spacing between components should be handled primarily with
utility classes or similar custom classes.

<InlineNotification title="TODO-AH: define and document internal/external spacing tokens"/>

However, it's important to be able to control spacing between components, so EDS works well with tailwind utility 
classes like [margin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin).

```jsx
<InlineNotification title="lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" className="mb-5" />
```
