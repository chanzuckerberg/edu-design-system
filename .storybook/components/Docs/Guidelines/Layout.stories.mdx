# Layout

Layout for pages is a combination of spacing units between components, and responsive changes based on the available viewport. EDS provides
configururation to use with tailwind, if desired. At the core, EDS also provides tokens to use, which align with spacing units defined in design.

For more information on what Tailwind supplies, check out the following links:

* [Tailwind Columns](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/columns)
* [Tailwind Container](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container)
* [Tailwind Display](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/display)

## Spacing and alignment

EDS components do not include external margin properties as spacing between components should be handled primarily with
utility classes or similar custom classes.

However, it's important to be able to control spacing between components, so EDS works well with tailwind utility 
classes like [margin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin).

* [EDS Size Token Documentation](?path=/story/design-tokens-tier-1-definitions--sizes)

Below, we use one of the size units to demonstrate how to use EDS sizing utility classes (with tokens).

```jsx
<InlineNotification title="lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" className="mx-size-5" />
```

Just like with [standard tailwind spacing values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing), the `size-X` will correspond to those used in design, AND
be available across all the documented spacing utilities. For now, we provide these along side the built-in utilities, for compatibility.
