# Layout

<InlineNotification text="The layout components are being deprecated in favor of using TailwindCSS" variant="warning" />

Please refer to our documentation [on ZeroHeight](https://eds.czi.design/styleguide/s/36770/p/17f0a9-layout/b/66febf)
for suggested alternatives and patterns.

## Spacing and alignment

EDS components do not include margin properties as spacing between components should be handled primarily with 
tailwind utility classes or similar custom classes.

However, it's important to be able to control spacing between components, so EDS works well with tailwind utility 
classes like [margin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin).

```jsx
<InlineNotification text="lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" variant="success" className="mb-5" />
```
