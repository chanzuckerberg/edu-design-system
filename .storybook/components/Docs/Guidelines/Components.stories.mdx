# Working with EDS Components

This codebase contains all the components to successfully build the presentation view of product screens. These components are built to exactly match those seen in design mockups.

## Working with components

### Using components

Using EDS components in your React application involves first installing the EDS package as a dependency:

```bash
npm install @chanzuckerberg/eds
# or
yarn add @chanzuckerberg/eds
```

Next, import any needed components from the EDS component library into your application like so:

```js
import { Button } from '@chanzuckerberg/eds';
```

From there, call EDS components in your React application and pass in the desired values into each component's API:

```jsx
<Button
  variant="primary"
  onClick={...}
>
  Submit
  <Icon name="chevron-right" purpose="decorative" />
</Button>
```

Each EDS component is documented in Storybook, which surfaces each component's API and provides copy-and-paste code snippets. We're using the [atomic design methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#the-atomic-design-methodology) to categorize our components, but grouping them under a single "Components" category in Storybook. Information about the component category will appear in its documentation, or as annotations.

If you have questions or are experiencing any issues when working with EDS's components, please reach out for support via slack and the team will be happy to help.

### Creating a component

1. To create a component, run `yarn plop` in the command line.
2. The command will ask, "What is your component name?" Add your component name (you can either type `PageHeader` or `page header` and it will automatically generate the proper casing).
3. Edit component source code in accordance with [EDS's code guidelines][code-guidelines]
4. Create relevant stories for all component variants

### Component Beta status

When components are first created using the `plop` feature, they're given a beta tag in the `.stories` file and a line is added to the component docstring stating that the component is in beta. When the component is first officially released/announced internally, the component will be in beta, but it will leave beta in the following release.

Exceptions can be made for components that are still fluctuating and experiencing a lot of changes when the second release comes around.
