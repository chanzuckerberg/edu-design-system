# Design Tokens

EDS is a [themeable design system](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/creating-themeable-design-systems/) in order to support different brands, design language generations, and product families. [Design tokens](https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/) are a core part of building a EDS theme. Design tokens define low-level design values and apply those values to UI applications in order to manage the brand's look and feel separately from structural component styles.

## Style Dictionary

EDS uses [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) to manage design tokens. Style Dictionary transforms design token source files into various formats, including CSS variables, Sass variables, JSON, and native app-specific formats.

Tokens are defined as a collection of JSON files, which then get converted by Style Dictionary into the appropriate format — namely CSS custom properties — to be consumed by EDS components.

## Design token architecture

Design tokens live at `src/design-tokens`, and follows this directory structure:

```css
design-tokens
 |--tier-1-definitions
 |--tier-2-usage
 |--tier-3-component
```

- `tier-1-definitions` define the brand's core design values, serving as the raw materials for the UI's visual design.
- `tier-2-usage` house the semantic design values, which take Tier 1 token values and map them to specific UI applications.
- `tier-3-component` house the component-specific design values, which allow for more nuanced theming for components.

All tokens are prefixed with `eds-` to serve as a namespace and identifier for working with the system in production applications.

EDS's token architecture and nomenclature is as follows:

## Tier 1 tokens

Tier 1 tokens define the brand's design values. They can be thought of as a brand style guide converted into variables. Tier1 token values should not imply any UI usage, and should not be used directly by components. Instead, Tier 1 values should be mapped to Tier 2 values.

### Animation <a name="tier-1-animation"></a>

- `anim-fade-` for fading between frames (e.g. button background color changes, banner messages fading out, etc). Typically default to "quick" and "long" as values.
- `anim-move-` for defining movement durations (e.g. a modal floating up from the bottom of the screen, etc)
- `anim-ease-` for animation easing properties (`ease-in`, `ease-out`, cubic bezier values)

### Borders <a name="tier-1-borders"></a>

- `border-width-` for border widths. EDS defaults to abbreviated t-shirt sizes (e.g. `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) in accordance with the [EDS code guidelines](./?path=/story/documentation-guidelines-code-guidelines--page).
- `border-radius-` for border radius values. EDS defaults to t-shirt sizes, with additional "full" and "round"

### Breakpoints <a name="tier-1-breakpoints"></a>

- `bp-` for breakpoint. Typically default to t-shirt sizes (e.g. `bp-sm`, `bp-md`, etc). EDS[deliberately avoids](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/7-habits-of-highly-effective-media-queries/) using "mobile" and "tablet" and "desktop" as values, despite it being a common nomenclature. 

**NOTE**: These are currently defined directly as SCSS variables due to lack of support at the moment for CSS custom property media queries.

### Colors <a name="tier-1-colors"></a>

- `color-brand-` for brand-specific values (e.g. `color-brand-starbucks-green` or `color-brand-coca-cola-red`)
- `color-neutral-` for black, white, and grayscale (or similar) values (e.g. `color-neutral-white`, or `color-neutral-50`). EDS defaults to the [percentage gray](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/color-in-design-systems-a1c80f65fa3) instead of using values like "gray-light" and "gray-dark". `color-neutral-90` is closer to black and `color-neutral-02` is a very light gray.
- `color-transparent-` for semi-transparent values often used for backdrops and overlays (e.g. for a modal overlay)
- `color-other-` for any other useful colors, especially for utility colors like info, warning, error, success, and info. Note that the semantic value for these other colors are assigned at the Tier 2 token level.

### Layout <a name="tier-1-layout"></a>

- `l-max-width` caps the width of a layout container so it doesn't span the full width of the viewport.
- `l-linelength-width` for containing passages of text to a comfortable character length

### Shadows <a name="tier-1-shadows"></a>

- `box-shadow-` for box shadow definitions. Default to t-shirt sizes (e.g. `box-shadow-lg`).

### Size <a name="tier-1-size"></a>

- `size-base-unit-` describes the base unit which most size-based units (`margin`, `padding`, `width`, `height`, etc) will use. We set this to `0.5rem` (which is equivalent to `8px`) in order to adhere to an [8-point grid](https://medium.com/built-to-adapt/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632).

### Typography <a name="tier-1-typography"></a>

- `font-family-` for font family definitions. EDS defaults to "primary" and "secondary" for font-family definitions.
- `font-size-` for font size definitions. Font sizes are based on pixel sizes and use `rem` (e.g., `font-size-16` = `1rem`)
- `font-weight-` for the different weights. EDS defaults to "light", "medium", and "bold".
- `letter-spacing` for the spacing between text characters. This uses t-shirt sizes.
- `line-height-` for line height definitions. These are unitless relative values. Default to t-shirt sizes (e.g. `line-height-lg: 1.5` )

Individual presets and typography tokens are defined as a set of values to apply to the [CSS Font property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font).
See [Typography](/story/documentation-guidelines-typography--page) for more information.

### Z-index <a name="tier-1-z-index"></a>

- `z-index-` controls an item's position in the stacking order. For now, EDS defaults to values that map to "top", "bottom", and some set z-index values (e.g., 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500).

## Tier 2 usage tokens

Tier 2 tokens define a semantic UI layer. Tier 2 values use Tier 1 token values, mapping them to specific UI applications, which are in then used by individual component styles.

All Tier 2 tokens begin with the prefix `eds-theme-`. For specific documentation around specific theme tokens, please refer to the token page in Storybook, which articulate the role of each theme token.

### Borders <a name="tier-2-borders"></a>

- `border-width` defines the border width for the thickness. EDS defaults to `border-width-sm`.

### Colors <a name="tier-2-colors"></a>

Tier 2 color tokens specify categorization of colors, given a specific use within an application. The naming categories specify where and when they are used, but not which components they are used for, specifically. For that, we would use [tier-3 tokens](#tier-3-component-tokens).

Each token in this group is prefixed by `--eds-theme-color` and has certain suffixes based on the the broad categorization.

For more information, [refer to Storybook](/story/design-tokens-tier-2-usage--colors) for the existing tokens and their naming.

### Forms <a name="tier-2-forms"></a>

Defines the border width, radius, and color properties for form controls. These values are all mapped to other Tier 2 values and are considered optional in case remapping is required.

- `form-border-width` defines the default border width for any form element
- `form-border-radius` defines the default border radius used on any form element's border

## Tier 3 Component Tokens <a name="tier-3-component-tokens"></a>

Tier 3 component variables represent each component's specific values.

Naming for tier-3 tokens will use the following prefix:

```css
--eds-theme-[property]-[component-name]
```

With the rest matching a corresponding use for the given component. For example, if a modal is to have a specific header background color, the token to use is:

```css
--eds-theme-color-modal-brand-header-background
```

The suffix here is arbitrary, but uses similar naming to tier two tokens. When possible, any new tier 3 tokens should be a more specifically named tier 2 token, to keep the naming consistent.

See the current set of tier 3 tokens [in storybook](/story/design-tokens-tier-3-component--colors).


## Tailwind Class Tokens

If the EDS tailwind config theme is being used, Tier 2 and tier 3 color tokens are available as a part of tailwind utility classes, and can be used to apply to specific attributes to a component. Background(prefix: bg-), border(prefix: border-), and text(prefix: text-) colors will only be available for themselves specifically. e.g.:

### These will not work

```html
<!-- will NOT work since tier 1 colors are not available -->
<div className="bg-brand-grape-100"></div>
<!-- will NOT work since background utility classes don't have border colors -->
<div className="bg-link-neutral"></div>
```

### These will work
```html
<!-- will work since button colors are available across all color utility classes -->
<div className="bg-button-icon-brand"></div>
<!-- will work since border colors are available for border color utility classes -->
<div className="border-link-neutral"></div>
<!-- will reflect respective color utility tokens
      (background-brand-primary-strong and border-brand-primary-strong) -->
<div className="bg-brand-primary-strong border-brand-primary-strong"></div>
```
