# Typography

Typography in EDS follows [the same structure as design tokens](./?path=/story/documentation-guidelines-tokens--page), with the exception that typography operates as a _cluster_ of typography-specific style properties rather than a single style property.

## Tier 1: Typography values

These token values are _never to be used_ directly by components; these token values are assembled into typography presets.

Values include:

- `eds-font-family`
- `eds-font-size-XX`
- `eds-font-weight-XX`
- `eds-letter-spacing-XX`

## Tier 1: Typography presets

Just as with other Tier 1 tokens, typography presets shouldn't be used directly by components. Typography presets are mapped to specific semantic usage at the Tier 2 level.

Note: line-height values are [unitless](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height#prefer_unitless_numbers_for_line-height_values) and are specific to each preset, which is why the decision was made to exclude line height values from tokens.

All presets exist as inline `font:` values, and can be used in Tier 2 usages:

```css
font: var(--eds-typography-preset-001);
```

When defining a new usage, you can refer to the variable by name

```json
{
  "eds": {
    "theme": {
      "typography": {
        "headline": {
          "lg": {
            "value": "var(--eds-typography-preset-001-bold)"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Tier 2: Typography usage

Tier 2 typography values take the typography presets defined at the Tier 2 level and map them to a semantic usage value like so:

Similar to the example above, you can use the token names in components and other code, or to define higher-tier tokens.

These semantic values are then included in each component's style file:

```css
.breadcrumbs {
  font: var(--eds-theme-typography-body-sm);
}
```

And defining tier 3 tokens using lower token values:

```json
{
  "eds": {
    "theme": {
      "typography": {
        "tab": {
          "lg": {
            "@": {
              "value": "var(--eds-typography-preset-006-light)"
            },
            "active": {
              "value": "var(--eds-typography-preset-006)"
            }
          },
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
