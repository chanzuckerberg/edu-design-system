# Welcome to EDS

EDS is a design system that provides foundations to create a consistent, accessible web experience across products.

## Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a tool that provides a place for developers to build, document, and ship components as well as prototype ideas and pages.

### Storybook Structure and Contents

EDS' components follow the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology where smaller components work together to create larger components to create templates and pages. In the storybook navigation, we group the contents into a few broad categories, to help with navigation and scannability.

The navigation consists of:

- **Documentation** are a collection of guidelines and explanations for all the written content on this site.
- **Design Tokens** are the reusable CSS variables that can be themed in your application. They are grouped into tiers which describe the specificity of the tokens (with tier one values corresponding to basic definitions, and tier two corresponing to use cases referencing the tier one values, etc.)
- **Components** are all the exported offerings of EDS, combined in one list. They consist of various atoms, molecules, and organisms that can be used in a product, along with relevant documentation, implementation examples controls, and <kbd>tags</kbd> (describing the component type and status)
- **Pages** are a place to demonstrate layouts with other themes and presets applied. Right now, it houses a layout example using our nascent wireframe theme (used when prototyping).

### Storybook Features

Storybook offers several facilities to demonstrate how components behave. Some common ones to know about include:

- **Canvas** shows the component, and a panel where controls and other behaviors can be tested. Controls, in particular, correspond to the props provided by the components, and demonstrate the possible values when using the props. Use controls to see what the component can do.
- **Docs** show a more read-only variant of the component, along with in-code documentation for the component. By clicking on the different stories, it will scroll to the appropriate one instead of reloading the canvas.
- **Storybook View Options** allow for controlling the viewport, background color, and other details to help understand the component layout. Visually test how the component responds to different layouts

Storybook provides a lot of functionality, including [keyboard navigation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/browse-stories#sidebar-and-canvas). Explore [the docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) to learn more.
