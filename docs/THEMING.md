# Theming overview

"Theming", in the context of EDS, is the process of overriding the default styles of EDS components to match a different brand (or "theme"). The "Theming" directory in storybook demonstrates an exampls of theming â€” a "wireframe" (a non-theme that can be used for prototyping a product before it has an official brand).
